                <h3>Home Page + Template + Nav</h3>
                <p>
                    To create the Home page, Template, and Navigation (Nav), I utilized HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The HTML structure includes sections for the header, hero section, purpose to serve, best selling products, new products, and footer. Within the header, I implemented a navigation bar with links to various pages such as Home, Shop, Gallery, and Feedback. Additionally, I incorporated dropdown menus for Content Page and Page Editor links. CSS was used to style the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of the elements. JavaScript functions were employed to toggle the dropdown menus in the navigation bar. Finally, I integrated Font Awesome for icons and included external CSS and JavaScript files for further customization and functionality.</p>
                <a href="link_to_home_page">Visit the Home Page</a>
            </div>
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Feedback Page</h3>
                <p>I constructed this webpage using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The HTML defines the elements like header, navigation, feedback form, and footer. CSS styles the elements for visual appeal, while JavaScript adds interactivity, such as form validation and submission handling. The integration of external libraries like Font Awesome and SMTP.js enhances functionality and design options. Overall, a combination of these technologies was used to create a visually appealing and interactive webpage for user engagement.</p>
                <a href="link_to_feedback_page">Visit the Feedback Page</a>
            </div>
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Content Page</h3>
                <p>To create this webpage, I used HTML for the structure and content of the page, including sections, headers, images, and text. Then, I applied CSS for styling, such as setting background colors, fonts, padding, and alignment. Flexbox layout was utilized to arrange content within sections and maintain spacing. Additionally, I ensured responsiveness by setting maximum widths for images and using percentage-based widths for layout elements. Lastly, I incorporated shadow effects and border-radius for visual enhancements, and fixed positioning for the footer to keep it at the bottom of the viewport.</p>
